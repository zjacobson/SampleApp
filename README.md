# **Solution**
This repo contains a JAX-RS compliant API in Java that solves the Sample Problem (outlined [below]((#sample-problem))).

## Documentation
The API is documented via [Swagger](./swagger.yaml) and [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/7992fe51d76d7e73ce92).
* The Postman collection includes `Accept` headers to illustrate the endpoint generating JSON and XML. 
* The Gradle build script will generate the client code from swagger.yaml when the project is built.

## Design
The API has a single endpoint, `park` that handles both `GET` and a `POST`.  The `GET` flavor will use the sample rates 
included below.  The `POST` flavor takes in the rates to use in calulating the rate to be charged.  My thinking behind 
this design (since this API could not be a publically accessible API since anyone could pass in rates of $0) is that
this would be a stateless microservice. There would be a client service that would retrieve the rates
and pass those along to this service with the start & end times to calculate the rate. 
 
## Testing Strategy
Unit tests cover model classes (which are Lombok data classes with a bit of business logic to convert strings to enums or
filter collections) and the class that calculates the parking rate (`ParkingComputer`).  There is an integration test 
that tests how the rate calculation work with all the classes working together (`ParkingRateIntegrationTest`).
Finally, there is `ApiIntegrationTest` with launches an in-memory app instance and exercises the API (leveraging `JerseyTest`)


## Running the API
The following command will launch the server:
```./gradlew run```
The service will be listen on port 8080 - this is not configurable, but could simply be a command line
argument to `Main`.

## Deploying the API to a cloud service
The app can be deployed in a jax-rs compliant containter.  I ran in to [an issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46604406/when-jodatime-v-2-5-library-included-into-war-file-deployment-fails) with deploying to
a standalone Glassfish 5 container and then a [different issue](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463169) when deploying to Glassfish 4.

# **Sample Problem**


------------

#### Build an API that allows a user to enter a date time range and get back the rate at which they would be charged to park for that time span.

## Requirements

* Publish a repo on Github that i can clone and run on my local machine
* Use Java, Scala, Kotlin or Clojure to complete this.
   - Donâ€™t use Spring Boot, Dropwizard or Scalatra to do this, but feel free to use the libraries employed by those frameworks (eg JAX-RS, Jersey, Metrics, Jackson, Akka, Jetty, etc)
* API will need documentation and a contract published.  
* It should support JSON & XML over HTTP
* I should be able to curl against an API that computes a price for a specified datetime range given a JSON file of rates. 
* Rates will not span multiple days
* User input can span more than one day, but it just won't return a valid rate
* The user specifies input date/times as ISO-8601, but there is no corresponding time zone information for the configured
rates.  Assume that the rates are for a location with a timezone offset of 0, the rates configuration model need not specify a timezone offset.

Staff Engineer requirments
* Bonus points for Protocol Buffers
* Integration tests need to be in place. 
* I should also be able to publish that app to AWS/Azure/Google Cloud very simply.  
* Metrics for endpoint(s) captured and available to be queried via an endpoint  (eg average response time)



Sample file: 
```json
    {
      "rates": [
        {
          "days": "mon,tues,wed,thurs,fri",
          "times": "0600-1800",
          "price": 1500
        },
        {
          "days": "sat,sun",
          "times": "0600-2000",
          "price": 2000
        }
      ]
    }
```
     
 

Sample result:
Datetime ranges should be specified in isoformat.  A rate must completely encapsulate a datetime range for it to be available.

Rates will never overlap.
```
2015-07-01T07:00:00Z to 2015-07-01T12:00:00Z should yield 1500
2015-07-04T07:00:00Z to 2015-07-04T12:00:00Z should yield 2000
2015-07-04T07:00:00Z to 2015-07-04T20:00:00Z should yield unavailable
```
 
Sample JSON for testing
```json
{
    "rates": [
        {
            "days": "mon,tues,thurs",
            "times": "0900-2100",
            "price": 1500
        },
        {
            "days": "fri,sat,sun",
            "times": "0900-2100",
            "price": 2000
        },
        {
            "days": "wed",
            "times": "0600-1800",
            "price": 1750
        },
        {
            "days": "mon,wed,sat",
            "times": "0100-0500",
            "price": 1000
        },
        {
            "days": "sun,tues",
            "times": "0100-0700",
            "price": 925
        }
    ]
}

```
